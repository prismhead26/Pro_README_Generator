# Professional READme Generator

  ## Description:
  The main goal of this project is to build a professional READme generator so the file can be easily created, thus allowing more focus on the logic.
  After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of Nodejs and how to implement packages from the standard library as well as third-party libraries. I also learned the learned multiple ways on how to handle a promise with asyncronous code and really enjoyed the ability to test and debug locally. And lastly I learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code by implmenting a switch case statement, thus making the code shorter, more modular, and easier to understand!
